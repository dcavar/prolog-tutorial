(C) 2020 by [Damir Cavar], ...

This is a basic Prolog language proficiensy improvement and tutorial repo for the dicussion group at [Indiana University at Bloomington]. Feel free to use the code examples in a way compatible with the [Apache License Version 2.0] as specified in the accompanied LICENSE file.


## Tutorials

See for some tutorials:

- [SWI Prolog] (see Tutorial Menu)
- [The Franz Inc. Allegro Prolog documentation](https://franz.com/support/documentation/current/doc/prolog.html)


## Resources

You can use some of these Prolog environments:

- [SWI Prolog]
- [Allegro Common Lisp (and Allegro Prolog)](https://franz.com/products/packages/)


### Jupyter Notebook

To use the [Jupyter] Notebooks you might have to install [Python] and [Jupyter], and in addition a Prolog kernel:

- [Calysto Prolog Jupyter kernel](https://github.com/Calysto/calysto_prolog)
